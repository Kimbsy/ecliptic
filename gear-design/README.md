# gear-design

Using clunk to plan our some gear dimensions.

A simple spur gear can be described by the intersection of circles around a circle.Or at least kinda, we'll try and build this using openscad.

## Running locally

Run the clunk game to play around with gear dimensions:

``` bash
lein run
```

Start openscad:

``` bash
openscad CAD/gears.scad
```
